The following CSS code uses the `calc()` function to calculate the width of an element, but it has a syntax error that can cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

The issue is that there's a missing space between the `100%` and the `-` operator.  The `calc()` function requires spaces around arithmetic operators.
